// Package service — canonical match event type constants.
//
// These constants are the SINGLE source of truth for event_type string values
// written to `match_events.event_type` and read back by services and the
// frontend. Every writer MUST reference a constant from this file; every
// reader MUST compare against a constant from this file.
//
// Canonical casing policy: lowercase snake_case.
//
// Why this file exists: Phase 3 shipped with three layers of drift — writers
// emitted lowercase (`point_team1`, `timeout`), one writer emitted SCREAMING
// (`SCORE_OVERRIDE`), and a reader grepped for `TIMEOUT_CALLED` (never
// written). The frontend EventType union used SCREAMING_SNAKE and silently
// failed `EVENT_META[event_type]` lookups. See
// docs/superpowers/lessons/2026-04-16-phase-3-review-defects.md.
//
// Cross-language invariant: the set of constant values in this file MUST
// exactly match the `EventType` union in
// web/src/features/scoring/types.ts. Drift is caught by
// TestEventTypeConstants_MatchWriters in match_contract_test.go.
package service
